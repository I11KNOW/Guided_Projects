# My Guided Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my guided machine learning projects repository! 

This repository houses a collection of guided machine-learning projects that I have developed guided by great instructors I appreciate. 

Guided machine learning simplifies the process of building and deploying machine learning models by leveraging pre-built models, libraries, and frameworks.

# Introduction
In this repository, you'll find a variety of guided machine-learning projects covering different domains and use cases.

These projects showcase the application of guided machine-learning techniques and provide practical examples for learning and experimentation.

This repository is a comprehensive guide for beginners to advanced users looking to leverage guided machine-learning techniques in their projects.

# Features
Project Demos: Real-world guided machine learning projects with detailed explanations and code.

Tutorials: Step-by-step guides to help you understand and implement guided machine-learning techniques.

Code Snippets: Reusable code snippets for common tasks in guided machine learning workflows.

Documentation: Detailed documentation for each project, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.

# Usage

Follow the instructions provided in the project READ MY README.md to get started with each project.

# Contributing
Contributions to this guided machine learning projects repository are welcome! 

If you have your own guided machine-learning projects that you would like to share, feel free to submit a pull request. 

Contributions could include additional projects, improvements to existing projects, or bug fixes.
